By the project's completion, I aim to create a standard HTML website featuring structured layouts that facilitate easy styling, minimizing complexity.

I'll be developing a recipe website encompassing three webpages, each dedicated to one of Nigeria's most popular and mouthwatering dishes:

1. Jollof Rice
2. Egusi Soup
3. Fried Rice
